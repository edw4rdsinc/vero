## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

```javascript
// Events being tracked:
- Quiz Started
- Quiz Completed
- Quiz Completed (with quiz name)
```

### Check in Plausible Dashboard:

1. Go to: https://plausible.io/veroautoglass.com
2. Look for custom events:

### Expected Metrics (After 1 Month):

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Quiz Not Loading?

**Check 1: Script Source**
```html
<!-- Should be loading from: -->
<script src="https://windshieldadvisor.info/quiz-embed-seo.js"></script>
```

**Check 2: CORS Headers**
- Windshield Advisor server must allow embedding
- Check browser console for CORS errors

**Check 3: Partner ID**
```html
<!-- Verify this is set: -->
data-partner-id="vero-autoglass"
```

### Attribution Links Not Visible?

**Check CSS:**
```css
.quiz-attribution {
    font-size: 0.75rem;
    color: #6b7280;
    /* Should be visible, not display:none */
}
```

### Backlinks Not Showing in Search Console?

**Common Reasons:**
1. **Too soon** - Wait 2-4 weeks for Google to recrawl
2. **Not indexed** - Check if page is indexed: `site:veroautoglass.com/resources/`
3. **Noindex tag** - Verify no noindex in page meta
4. **Robots.txt blocking** - Check robots.txt allows crawling

**Force Recrawl:**
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Click "URL Inspection"
3. Enter: `https://veroautoglass.com/resources/`
4. Click "Request Indexing"
