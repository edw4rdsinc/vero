# ✅ Vero Quiz Integration - COMPLETE

## What's Been Done

### ✅ Step 1: Files Deployed

**Location:** `/resources/index.html`

**Backup created:** `/resources/index.html.backup`

**What's included:**
- All 5 Windshield Advisor quizzes embedded
- Full Vero branding (orange #ff4d00, Inter font, dark gray headers)
- SEO attribution for Windshield Advisor (10-15 backlinks)
- Structured data with citations
- Plausible analytics tracking
- Mobile responsive design

---

### ✅ Step 2: Local Testing Setup

**Test server running:**
```
URL: http://localhost:8080/resources/
Port: 8080
Status: Running
```

**⚠️ Local Testing Limitation:**
Quizzes won't be interactive locally because they load from windshieldadvisor.info (which must be live). See `LOCAL_TESTING_NOTE.md` for details.

**What you CAN test locally:**
1. ✅ Page layout and structure
2. ✅ Vero branding (orange colors, fonts)
3. ✅ Attribution footer text
4. ✅ Responsive design
5. ✅ CTA buttons and links

**What needs production:**
- ❌ Interactive quiz functionality (requires live windshieldadvisor.info)

**To stop server:**
```bash
# Find the process
ps aux | grep "python3 -m http.server 8080"

# Kill it
kill [PID]
```
